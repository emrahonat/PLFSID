Quality-Aware Pixel-Level Fusion for Robust SAR Image Despeckling
=================================================================

Overview
---------
This repository currently includes main.m file and Napoli images (noisy and noiseless).
The purpose of main file is to provide an overview of the academic work and its implementation framework.
All MATLAB files related to the despeckling algorithms and fusion method developed in this study will be uploaded after the corresponding paper is accepted for publication.

Contents
--------
main.m: Demonstrates the general structure of the despeckling and fusion process.
Additional MATLAB scripts and functions will be made publicly available after the paper’s acceptance.

Usage
-----
The current code is intended for demonstration purposes only.
After the paper is accepted and the full implementation is released, all scripts may be used freely for academic and non-commercial research, provided that proper citation is given.

Citation
--------
If you use or refer to this work, please cite the forthcoming paper once it is published.
A complete BibTeX entry will be provided here after publication.

License
-------
This repository will be released under an academic open-use license after publication.
Until then, redistribution or modification of the included code is not permitted without the author’s consent.
